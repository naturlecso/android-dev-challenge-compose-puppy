# Puppy list
(Such a unique name, wow)

## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a simple list-detail application using the Jetpack Compose library for the UI layer. As the app is focusing only on the UI, it uses mock data for the puppies :file_cabinet:


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
The point of this app is improving my Compose skills (the Lego robot looks cool too :wink:). 
I wanted to add a minimal randomness to the :dog: data, which sometimes produces weird combinations :tada: 
The navigation has been done with the new navigation-compose library.
